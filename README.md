This C++ program allows users to input a binary array, verify its validity, flip its bits (i.e., change every 0 to 1 and every 1 to 0), and extract a substring of specified length from it.

💡 Features
✅ Dynamic input of binary values (0 or 1) only

❌ Rejects non-binary inputs with colored error messages

🔁 Flips the entire binary array after validation
